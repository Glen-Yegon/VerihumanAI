It\u2019s hard when classes aren\u2019t going as expected and your own plans get affected.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help with:\n- Writing a message to the administration or your student union to express concerns\n- A plan for staying on top of coursework during the strike (reading lists, alternative online resources, study schedule)\n- Tips for staying calm and organized during uncertainty\n\nA couple of quick questions:\n- Which institution are you at, and what\u2019s the current situation (classes paused, limited schedule, online alternatives)?\n- Do you want help drafting a short note to your lecturers, administrators, or classmates?\n\nIf you want a quick, generic note you could send to your department, here\u2019s a simple option:\n\u201cDear [Department/Administration], I understand lecturers are on strike due to payment issues. I\u2019m concerned about my coursework and deadlines and would appreciate guidance on how we should proceed with assignments and exams during the strike. Could you please provide an update on scheduling and any available alternatives or resources for students? Thank you.\u201d\n\nLet me know what you\u2019d prefer, and I\u2019ll tailor it.",
