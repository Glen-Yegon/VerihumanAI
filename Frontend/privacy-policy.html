            <p>
              The Service is operated by <strong>VeriHuman Limited</strong>, incorporated in Kenya.
              For the purposes of applicable data protection laws, VeriHuman Limited acts as a <strong>data controller</strong>
              for personal data collected through the Service, unless we clearly state otherwise (for example, where we act as a processor for an enterprise customer).
            </p>
            <div class="vh-privacy__note">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> If you use VeriHuman through a company/organization account, that organization may be the controller for some processing,
              and we may act as a processor. Contact your organization for their internal privacy details.

              <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (for example, certain cookies or marketing communications). You can withdraw consent at any time where it applies.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> to meet legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements, and respond to lawful requests.</li>

            <h2>6. AI features &amp; content processing</h2>
            <p>
              VeriHuman processes the text you submit to generate outputs (chat responses, detection likelihood signals, or rewritten text).
              We may also process technical and usage signals to enforce rate limits, protect the Service, and prevent misuse.
            </p>

            <h3>6.1 Inputs and outputs</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> the text and prompts you submit.</li>
              <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> the results generated by the Service.</li>
              <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> you are responsible for ensuring you have the rights and permissions to submit Inputs and to use Outputs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.2 Model training and improvement</h3>
            <p>
              We may use a combination of (a) aggregate usage patterns, (b) de-identified or anonymized signals, and (c) limited samples for quality and safety review
              to improve the Service. Where required by law, we will obtain your consent or provide opt-out choices within the product or via support.
            </p>

            <h3>6.3 Human review</h3>
            <p>
              We generally rely on automated systems. However, authorized personnel may review limited data to investigate abuse, respond to support requests,
              resolve technical issues, or comply with legal obligations.

            <h2>15. Automated decisions</h2>
            <p>
              Some features may use automated processing (for example, abuse detection, rate limiting, or detection scoring).
              These systems are designed to protect the Service and provide results, but they may not be perfect. If an automated decision significantly affects you
              (for example, an account restriction), you may contact us to request review where applicable.
