              Some parts of the Service are offered on a subscription, usage-based, credit-based, or hybrid billing model. Pricing, plan limits,
              and included features are described on our pricing page or within your account dashboard and may change as described in Section 20.
            </p>

            <h3>8.2 Billing and renewals</h3>
            <ul>

            <p>
              Unless required by applicable law, payments are generally non-refundable. However, we may consider refunds or credits in limited cases,
              such as duplicate charges, billing errors, or material service failure not caused by misuse or Third-Party Services, at our reasonable discretion.
              If you cancel, you will typically retain access until the end of your current billing period. We do not provide refunds for unused time,
              unused credits, or partial billing periods unless required by law.
            </p>

            <h3>8.4 Failed payments</h3>
            <p>
              If payment fails or becomes overdue, we may suspend or restrict access to paid features until payment is received. You remain responsible
              for all charges incurred up to suspension or termination.
